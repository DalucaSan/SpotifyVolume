Spotify doesn't have shortcuts to change the audio of music while the app is in the background (NO, changing your whole audio isn't "changing spotify's audio" it is changing your pc's audio) 
This is a small python code which runs in the background to change the audio with 2 simple keys.
(The default keys are F23-F24 which are not used and easily bindable with Macro's or your keyboard's software (or Wootautomation)

How to use it: 
First time:
- Make an account on [Spotify Dev Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- Make an app
- Copy your "Client ID" and "Client secret" to access the API
- launch the app (it should close because it doesn't have your credentials)
- put your credentials in the congif file that has been created after launching for the first time
#TEMPORARY ISSUE:
# Spotify asks for a Redirect URI which my exe can't do because I didn't want a visible console
- Launch it again
- Enjoy
